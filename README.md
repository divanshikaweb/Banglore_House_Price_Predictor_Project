# 🏠 Banglore House Price Predictor Project

A web-based machine learning project to **predict house prices in Bangalore** based on user inputs such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms.

This project uses a trained machine learning model with a **Flask backend** and a **Bootstrap-based frontend** to provide real-time predictions in a user-friendly interface.
